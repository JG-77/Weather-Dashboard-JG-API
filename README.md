## Description 
The Weather Dash application allows users to search up cities and get the current weather along with a 5-day forecast. The user will be able to see temperatures, humidity, weather icons, the date of forecasts, and the current uv index. User's valid searches will display on the search history under the search bar section, and this history can be cleared with the click of the 'clear' button. All weather information is called using the Open Weather API documentation to help make this functionality possible.
